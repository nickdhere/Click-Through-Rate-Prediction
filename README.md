# Click Through Rate Prediction

Unlock online ad success! Predict user engagement, optimize placements, and master CTR with data insights.

## Welcome to our Click Through Rate Prediction Project!

In the ever-evolving landscape of online advertising, making data-driven decisions is paramount. This project delves into the world of CTR prediction, where we aim to unlock the secrets of audience engagement.

### Objective

Our primary objective is to develop and recommend a machine learning model for ad click prediction. This includes method selection and assessing associated risks.
